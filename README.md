# 🤓 Today I Learned

Every day, you are expected to file an issue on this repo with a brief journal entry of some things that you learned.

Make sure the issue has a label of `Today I Learned`. This is another component of your daily attendance 😁

You are encouraged to add code snippets, images, and links to projects you created in class.

You will need to use [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

You can add other labels when appropriate, like `Question` or `Help Wanted`.  

## Official Notetaker

There will be a rotating official notetaker each day.  When it's your day, take extra care to take _comprehensive_ notes.  Add the `Official Notes` label to your issue when it's your turn.
